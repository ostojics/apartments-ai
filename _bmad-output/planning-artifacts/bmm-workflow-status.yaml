  Product brief and PRD completed. Core UX user flows for the public chat MVP have been drafted, including step-by-step flows, wireframe descriptions, and branding requirements (see ux-core-user-flow.md).

  Architecture planning completed:
    - Baseline architecture documented for backend (NestJS, DDD, modular monolith) and frontend (React, Vite, modular structure).
    - Multi-tenant architecture approach defined: subdomain-based tenant isolation, tenant_id in all records, tenant-aware backend and frontend logic.
    - Architecture file created in planning artifacts.

  Project is ready to proceed to detailed implementation planning and actionable artifacts for the public chat MVP and multi-tenant features.
