# Product Brief: host-elite

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## Product Vision

Apartment owners don't have to manually respond to repeated questions from their guests; instead, the AI assistant handles those queries for them.

## Target Users

- **Guests:**
  - Need quick access to common information (e.g., WiFi password, check-out process).
  - Benefit from 24/7 support via the AI agent, without requiring the owner's presence.

- **Owners:**
  - Can delegate repetitive guest communication to the AI agent.
  - Do not need to be available at all times, as the AI handles guest queries autonomously.

## Success Metrics

- Guests have 24/7 access to all necessary apartment information without needing to rely on the owner.
- Guest satisfaction (e.g., positive feedback, reduced repetitive questions).
- Owner time saved by delegating guest communication to the AI assistant.

## MVP Scope

- Users access a tenant-specific URL (e.g., tenant.domain.com), select their language, and interact with a chat interface to ask questions about the apartment.
- Apartment data is provided by clients/tenants and stored for retrieval by the AI assistant (LLM calls).

## Future Vision

- Automatic FAQ data aggregation.
- Advanced analytics and review request reminders.
- Additional features to enhance guest and owner experience.
