# Story: S-apartment-02 – Custom Markdown Rendering

Status: not-started

## Description

Implement custom React components for markdown rendering in the apartments module. Ensure headings, paragraphs, and other markdown elements are rendered professionally, are mobile responsive, and align with the product style guide. The markdownContent variable should remain for testing, but the main apartment page component must stay under 150 lines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Custom components for markdown elements (headings, paragraphs, etc.)
