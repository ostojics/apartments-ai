# Story: S-apartment-01-promotion-copy – Promotion Tab Copy Improvements

Status: not-started

## Description

Update the promotion tab copy on the apartment page to clearly communicate:

- Promotions and special discounts are provided by the apartment provider/owner, not the HostElite product itself
- Guests can opt out or cancel receiving offers at any time
- Copy should be brief, clear, and not take excessive space, but must explain the feature's purpose and opt-out option

## Acceptance Criteria

- Promotion tab copy clearly states offers are from the apartment provider/owner
- Copy includes a brief opt-out/cancel message for guests
- Copy is concise and fits well in the UI
- All static text is localized
- Copy is mobile responsive
