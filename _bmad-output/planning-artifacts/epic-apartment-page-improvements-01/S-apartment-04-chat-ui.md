# Story: S-apartment-04 – Apartment Chat Interface UI

Status: not-started

## Description

Design and implement a sleek, modern chat interface UI for the apartment page. The interface should support receiving and displaying messages in a conversation with an AI agent. Messages are represented as an array of items, each containing message content and a role (either the user or the AI assistant). The UI must be simple, visually appealing, and focused on core chat functionality only. The interface should display these messages properly, clearly distinguishing between user and assistant roles.
